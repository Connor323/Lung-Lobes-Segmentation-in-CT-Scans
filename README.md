# Lung-Lobes-Segmentation-in-CT-Scans

Python and C++ implementation on vessel and fissure segmentation in Lung CT Scans based on [Bianca's work](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ddd9/8a73eab745841ba41a13633be76ab1f9c8b0.pdf)

## Usage
**For lung and pulmonary vessel segmentation**. 

I create a ipython notebook for this part (in lung_segmentation.ipynb except the last two parts).

**For pulmonary fissure segmentation**. 

Compile the two C++ files for fissure segmentation.
1. cmake .
2. make
3. 
	Use vector-based region growing for fissure segmention. 
	```Python
	./vector_region_growing ORIGINAL_CT.mhd FISSURE_EXTRACT.mhd
	```
	Use intensity-based region growing for removing small regions.
	```Python
	./region_growing FISSURE_EXTRACT.mhd FISSURE_EXTRACT_REFINED.mhd
	```
4. Running the last two sections in the ipython notebook to generate fissure mask and final lung-vessel-fissure mask.

## Dataset
The dataset I used is [LOLA11](https://lola11.grand-challenge.org), which contains 55 CT Scans.
